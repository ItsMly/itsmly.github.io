You need:\nA replacement driver (e.g., Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250-ohm driver) A soldering iron A multimeter Screwdrivers 1. Take Apart Your Headphones # Gently pull off the ear pads with your fingers. Use a flat screwdriver to remove the plastic ring holding everything in place. Remove the foam filter and carefully take out the speaker housing. 2. Test the Driver # Use a multimeter to check if the wiring is working Ohm (Ω). If it shows nothing, it’s dead and needs replacing. You can also measure the driver itself by changing your multimeter to Ohm (Ω) and putting one tip on the far left contact and the other on the far right contact. You should get the Ohm of your driver (e.g. 32ohms, 250ohms or 600ohms) 3. Install the New Driver # Blue Wire = Left channel\nRed wire = Right channel\nCopper wire = Ground\nOr if newer Color:\nWhite Wire = Left channel\nRed wire = Right channel\nBlack wire = Ground\nBe careful when soldering - if you heat it too long you will damage the driver inside. Solder hot and fast!\nAlso check out this Picture Guide\nCredits: https://www.reddit.com/user/Not_Finn/\nVariants of Beyerdynamic Drivers #Beyerdynamic headphones come with different driver variants. Beyerdynamic drivers do not have consistent polarity within a model. Knowing the type you have is essential for repairs or modifications:\n3-Pin Drivers:\nThese are simpler drivers with three connection points. One side is marked to indicate the positive terminal. 6-Pin Drivers with 0\u0026hellip;1 Markings:\nMarked/printed with \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; on the back. 0 = Ground/Negative, 1 = Positive. 6-Pin Drivers Without Markings:\nOne side is marked to indicate the positive terminal. Avoiding Phase Issues #If you accidentally switch the \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; connections on the 6-pin drivers, your headphones will be out of phase. This will make the sound feel unnatural or “not right.” Use this phase test video to verify and correct the wiring if needed.\n4. Reassemble Your Headphones # Place the new driver back into its housing. Make sure it fits snugly into the groove. Put the foam filter back on top, secure it with the plastic ring, and slide the ear pads back into place. Damaged Cables? #If your issue is with a broken cable, here’s how to fix it:\nThe headphone jack has three parts:\nTip = Left channel (blue wire) Ring = Right channel (red wire) Sleeve = Ground (copper wire) Or if newer Color:\nWhite Wire = Left channel Red wire = Right channel Black wire = Ground Simply replace or re-solder any broken wires back to their correct positions.\nExtra Resources #Check out this awesome Guide to switch to XLR Cable for step-by-step instructions on adding a mini-XLR mod.

It can also occur if devices from a previous network are still active. Below is a step-by-step guide to help resolve this issue.\nCommon Causes # Starting Zigbee2MQTT before migrating the configuration:\nIf the coordinator initializes a new network, it may clash with an existing one nearby.\nModifying and reverting network identifiers (PAN ID, Extended PAN ID, or Network Key):\nInconsistencies between the coordinator and connected devices can cause the error.\nActive Zigbee routers from the previous network:\nThese devices might still try to connect using the old network configuration, leading to conflicts.\nSteps to Resolve the Issue #1. Turn Off All Zigbee Routers #Before starting Zigbee2MQTT with a restored backup:\nDisconnect all Zigbee routers (e.g., smart plugs or repeaters) by unplugging them or cutting off their power supply. This step prevents interference during the commissioning process. 2. Restore Your Backup #Ensure you restore these key files from your backup:\ncoordinator_backup.json: Contains the network configuration for the coordinator. database.db: Stores paired device information and states. state.json: Maintains runtime data. Copy these files into your Zigbee2MQTT data directory (e.g., /data/zigbee2mqtt).\n3. Start Zigbee2MQTT # Start Zigbee2MQTT after restoring the backup and monitor the logs for errors. Once it starts successfully, reconnect power to all Zigbee routers. If no devices appear joined after starting Zigbee2MQTT, stop it, reapply the backup files, and restart the service.\n4. Allow Time for Network Stabilization #Zigbee networks may take time to stabilize:\nWait about 10 minutes for routers and end devices to rejoin automatically. If you have lost all hope - or you don\u0026rsquo;t have devices joined yet, you can create a new network with adding the following to your config. Remove old entries for pan_id, ext_pan_id and network_key\nadvanced: pan_id: GENERATE ext_pan_id: GENERATE network_key: GENERATE ","date":"5 January 2025","permalink":"/various/zigbee2mqtt-migration-issues/","section":"Various / Misc","summary":"","title":"Resolving Zigbee2MQTT Migration Issues: Network Commissioning Timed Out"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/smart-home/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Smart-Home"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/zigbee2mqtt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zigbee2MQTT"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/azure/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Azure"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/fido2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"FIDO2"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/hardware-token/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hardware Token"},{"content":"Overview #FIDO2 security keys offer a secure and convenient passwordless authentication method. For organizations where employees either lack company-issued phones or prefer not to use personal devices for authentication, this hardware token becomes a viable alternative. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to implement FIDO2/YubiKey as the sole authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID.\nWithout configuring a Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) exception, users relying solely on a FIDO2/Yubikey will be prompted to add the Microsoft Authenticator.\nA solution for this can be found in the chapter: Handling SSPR\nImplementation Steps #Enable FIDO2 Authentication\nNavigate to the Microsoft Entra Admin Center. Go to Authentication methods under the Protection section. Enable Passkey (FIDO2) for your target users. Configure Temporary Access Pass (TAP)\nEnable TAP in Authentication Methods Settings. Configure the appropriate lifetime duration (1 to 24 hours). Use TAP for initial FIDO2 registration and recovery scenarios. User Registration Process\nAdmin generates a Temporary Access Pass (TAP) for the user. The user logs in at mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info by using the TAP. The user registers their FIDO2 security key. Security Benefits # Phishing-resistant authentication No dependency on mobile devices Reduced password-related IT support Compatible with Windows 10/11 devices and web applications This setup eliminates the need for Microsoft Authenticator while maintaining robust security through hardware-based authentication tokens.\nHandling SSPR # When a user relies solely on a FIDO2 Key, it is essential to exclude them from Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) configurations. Since only one include group can be specified for SSPR, you must create a group containing all users except those who exclusively use FIDO2 keys. For example, if you have 100 users and need to exclude 2, you must create a group of the remaining 98 users.\nYou have multiple possibilities in creating your SSPR Group:\nCreate a dynamic group, exclude any user who has a specific attribute and include everyone else. Disadvantage: For more than a handful people it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of manual work. Create an Azure Automation that fills a group with users that are allowed to use SSPR: Select all users excluding those that have a FIDO2 hardware token.\nDisadvantage: New users will be prompted to add the authenticator until the script runs Select Users that have one or two SSPR compatible Authentication methods\nDisadvantage: Users that do not have an authentication method registered, will not get prompted to register one. These options all require that you need to have a Conditional Access Policy that targets all users for MFA enrollment because of the following:\nEnabling the \u0026ldquo;Require users to register when signing in?\u0026rdquo; option only applies to the group specified for SSPR registration. Azure Automation #In this guide we will go with Option:\nSelect Users that have one SSPR compatible Authentication methods\nUse the following Code in your Automation. (Not recommended, but you can also run this script manually) After that add the Group $groupId as SSPR-Enabled Group.\nPrerequisit Modules:\nMicrosoft.Graph Code: #Code can also be found in our Repository: Samily-Scripts\n## Variable Declartion Start ## $clientId = \u0026#34;InsertClientID\u0026#34; $tenantId = \u0026#34;InsertTenantID\u0026#34; $thumbprint = \u0026#34;InsertThumbprint\u0026#34; $groupId = \u0026#34;InsertGroupID\u0026#34; # Replace with the Object ID of your target group # Insert Enabled Authentication Methods $authMethodsToCheck = @(\u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethod\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.smsAuthenticationMethod\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.emailAuthenticationMethod\u0026#34;) #Optional UPN Filter #$UPNs = @(\u0026#34;xyz.com\u0026#34;, # \u0026#34;abc.com\u0026#34;) ## Variable Declartion End ## Connect-MgGraph -ClientId $clientId -TenantId $tenantId -CertificateThumbprint $thumbprint -NoWelcome # Get all users in Azure AD $users = Get-MgUser -All -ConsistencyLevel eventual -Property Id,UserPrincipalName $totalUsers = $users.Count # Total number of users for progress tracking $currentUser = 0 # Counter for processed users Write-Output \u0026#34;Getting Users\u0026#34; # Initialize list for eligible users $eligibleUsers = @() Write-Output \u0026#34;Checking Users - Outputting Status in 50 User Increments\u0026#34; # Iterate through each user and check their authentication methods foreach ($user in $users) { $currentUser++ if ($currentUser % 50 -eq 0) { Write-Output \u0026#34;Checking user $currentUser/$totalUsers\u0026#34; } $eligible = $true #Optional UPN Filter # foreach ($UPN in $UPNs) { # if ($user.UserPrincipalName -like \u0026#34;*$UPN\u0026#34;) { # $eligible = $false # break # } # } if ($eligible) { try { # Retrieve authentication methods for the user $authMethods = Get-MgUserAuthenticationMethod -UserId $user.Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue # Extract method types $authMethodTypes = $authMethods | ForEach-Object { $_.AdditionalProperties[\u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;] } # Check if user has at least one of the allowed authentication methods $hasAllowedAuthMethod = $false foreach ($method in $authMethodTypes) { if ($authMethodsToCheck -contains $method) { $hasAllowedAuthMethod = $true break } } # Add user to eligible list only if they have an allowed method if ($hasAllowedAuthMethod) { $eligibleUsers += $user.Id } } catch { Write-Output \u0026#34;Error processing user $($user.UserPrincipalName): $_\u0026#34; continue } } } Write-Output \u0026#34;`nFinished checking users.\u0026#34; # Add eligible users to the group, with progress updates $totalEligibleUsers = $eligibleUsers.Count # Total number of eligible users $currentEligibleUser = 0 # Counter for added eligible users $newMembersAdded = 0 foreach ($userId in $eligibleUsers) { $currentEligibleUser++ # Update progress on the same line for adding users to the group Write-Output -NoNewline \u0026#34;`rAdding eligible user $currentEligibleUser/$totalEligibleUsers to the group\u0026#34; try { # Check if user is already a member of the group $isMember = Get-MgGroupMember -GroupId $groupId -All | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq $userId } if (-not $isMember) { New-MgGroupMember -GroupId $groupId -DirectoryObjectId $userId $newMembersAdded++ } } catch { Write-Output \u0026#34;Could not add $userId to Group.\u0026#34; continue } } Write-Output \u0026#34;`n`n----------------------------------------`n`n\u0026#34; Write-Output \u0026#34;Process finished - Checked $totalUsers users - $($eligibleUsers.Count) users were eligible - Added $newMembersAdded new members to group\u0026#34; ","date":"20 December 2024","permalink":"/posts/fido-key-azure/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Implementing FIDO2 / YubiKey in Microsoft Entra ID Without Mobile Authenticator and handling Self-Service-Password-Reset (SSPR)"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"Unfortunately, in OPNsense, it is not possible to set the TTL (Time to Live) for Dynamic DNS, which means DNS entries always have a TTL of 10800 seconds or 3 hours.

To check the current sector size, use the nvme id-ns command:\n$ nvme id-ns /dev/nvme0n1 ... lbaf 0 : ms:0 lbads:9 rp:0 lbaf 1 : ms:0 lbads:12 rp:0 (in use) Look for the lbaf (Logical Block Addressing Format) entries: lbaf 0: 512 bytes sector size (lbads:9) lbaf 1: 4k sector size (lbads:12)\nTo switch the sector size, use the nvme format command. Warning: This will format the drive! Backup your data.\nWarning: This formats the drive! Backup your Data $ nvme format /dev/nvme0n1 --lbaf=1 --reset lbaf=x where x is the slot with the lbads:y we want.\nNow, we have switched the sector size to 4k sectors. :)\n","date":"1 August 2024","permalink":"/various/fw-update-pm983/","section":"Various / Misc","summary":"","title":"Step-by-Step Guide: Firmware Update and Sector Alignment for Samsung PM983 SSD"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/azure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Azure"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PowerShell"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/powershell/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"PowerShell"},{"content":"This blog post will guide you through a PowerShell script that uses the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module to remove user photos in bulk.\nThis can be particularly useful for cleaning up disabled user accounts.\nPrerequisites #Before you begin, ensure you have the following:\nMicrosoft Graph PowerShell Module: Install it by running Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Force in your PowerShell terminal.

One way to achieve this is by creating a Progressive Web App in Microsoft Edge. However this does not work for every site. For Example Microsoft Forms.\nIn this blog post, I show you a PowerShell script that does just that: it creates a desktop shortcut that opens a specific webpage in a \u0026ldquo;Fake\u0026rdquo; Edge App window.\nOverview of the Script #The script we present here creates a desktop shortcut that opens a specific URL in an Edge window. The window is configured to look like a standalone application, which can be particularly useful for frequently accessed web applications.\nScript Details #Here is the complete code of the script:\n\u0026lt;# .Synopsis Creates a \u0026#34;Fake\u0026#34; Edge App .INPUTS Change $websiteURL, $shortcutPath, $logFile, $icoPath, $icoDestinationPath .OUTPUTS $logFile Path Transcript #\u0026gt; # URL $websiteURL = \u0026#34;google.de\u0026#34; # Get the path to the Public Desktop folder using the special folder identifier $publicDesktopPath = [System.Environment]::GetFolderPath(\u0026#39;CommonDesktopDirectory\u0026#39;) # Define the path to the shortcut $shortcutPath = Join-Path -Path $publicDesktopPath -ChildPath \u0026#39;NameOfLink.lnk\u0026#39; # Remove Old lnk if it exists (For Link Updates with same Link name.) if (Test-Path -Path $shortcutPath) { Remove-Item -Path $shortcutPath -Force Write-Output \u0026#34;Old shortcut removed: $shortcutPath\u0026#34; } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;No existing shortcut found at: $shortcutPath\u0026#34; } # Drop an icon with the .ico extention in the same directory the script will run from. # Define the source and destination paths $icoPath = \u0026#34;NameOfLink.ico\u0026#34; $icoDestinationPath = \u0026#34;$env:ProgramFiles\\Samily\\Icons\\NameOfLink.ico\u0026#34; # Create the destination directory if it does not exist $destinationDir = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($icoDestinationPath) if (-not (Test-Path -Path $destinationDir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $destinationDir } # Copy the file to the destination Copy-Item -Path $icoPath -Destination $icoDestinationPath -Force # Verify the file was copied if (Test-Path -Path $icoDestinationPath) { Write-Output \u0026#34;File copied successfully to $icoDestinationPath\u0026#34; } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;Failed to copy the file.\u0026#34; } $WshShell = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell $Shortcut = $WshShell.CreateShortcut(\u0026#34;$shortcutPath\u0026#34;) $Shortcut.TargetPath = \u0026#34;%SystemDrive%\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\u0026#34; $Shortcut.Arguments = \u0026#34;/C start `\u0026#34;`\u0026#34; /min `\u0026#34;%SystemDrive%\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe`\u0026#34; --app=$($websiteURL) --start-windowed\u0026#34; $Shortcut.IconLocation = \u0026#34;$icoDestinationPath\u0026#34; $Shortcut.Save() How the Script Works #The script performs the following steps:\nURL Definition: The URL of the webpage to be opened is stored in the $websiteURL variable. Desktop Path: The path to the public desktop folder is obtained. Shortcut Path: The path where the shortcut will be created is defined. Remove Old Shortcut: If a shortcut with the same name already exists, it is removed. Copy Icon File: An icon file is copied to the destination directory. Create Shortcut: A new shortcut is created that opens the defined URL in an Edge window. Customization Options #The script can be easily customized by changing the following variables:\n$websiteURL: The URL of the webpage to be opened. $shortcutPath: The path where the shortcut will be created. $logFile: The path to the log file. $icoPath and $icoDestinationPath: Paths to the icon file. Conclusion #This PowerShell script provides a simple way to create a desktop shortcut that opens a webpage in a \u0026ldquo;Fake\u0026rdquo; Edge App window. It is particularly useful for users who frequently access specific web applications and want seamless integration into their desktop environment. With a few adjustments, the script can be easily tailored to individual needs.\nAnd best of it: It can be installed as an .intuneWin App.\n","date":"25 July 2024","permalink":"/posts/fake-edge-app/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Fake Edge App: A PowerShell Script to Create a Web App Shortcut"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/intune/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intune"},{"content":"About Us #Welcome to our blog!
